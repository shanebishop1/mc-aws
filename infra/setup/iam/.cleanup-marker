# CLEANUP MARKER - Step 3 Complete

This directory contained manual-only IAM policy templates that are now obsolete.

All IAM policies are now generated programmatically by the CDK stack (lib/minecraft-stack.ts).

The following files should be deleted via `git rm`:
- allow-read-github-pat-policy.json
- ec2-start-describe-policy.json
- ec2-stop-instance-policy.json
- ses-send-email-policy.json
- trust-policy.json

After deletion, this directory can also be removed if empty.
